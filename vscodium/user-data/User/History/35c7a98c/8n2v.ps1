This will remove the directory .git/sensitive-dir from the branch filtered-branch. When you push the branch to the remote repository, the sensitive information will be removed from the repository.

Using git-filter-repo to remove large files from a repository before cloning it:
# Create a new repository to filter
git init filtered-repo

# Filter the contents of the repository
git filter-repo --subdirectory-filter 'git-annex add --to filtered-repo'

# Clone the filtered repository
git clone filtered-repo
This will copy all of the large files from the repository to a new repository called filtered-repo. When you clone the filtered-repo repository, the large files will not be included in the clone.

These are just a few examples of how git filter drivers can be used. There are many other ways to use git filter drivers, and the possibilities are endless.


To configure git-annex, you can use the git annex config command. This command allows you to set various configuration options, such as the location of the remote repository and the types of files that should be stored in the remote repository.

Here are some common git-annex configuration options:

annex.remote - This option specifies the location of the remote repository.
annex.content - This option specifies the types of files that should be stored in the remote repository.
annex.numcopies - This option specifies the number of copies of each file that should be stored in the remote repository.
annex.symlinks - This option specifies whether or not git-annex should create symlinks to files that are stored in the remote repository.
You can set these configuration options in the .gitconfig file in your home directory, or in the .git/annex.conf file in your Git repository.

Here is an example of how to configure git-annex to store all large files (files larger than 10 MB) in a remote repository called my-remote:

# Set the remote repository location
git annex config annex.remote my-remote

# Set the content to be stored in the remote repository
git annex config annex.content "size>10M"
Once you have configured git-annex, you can start adding files to the remote repository. To do this, simply run the git annex add command.

For example, to add the file large_file.txt to the remote repository, you would run the following command:

git annex add large_file.txt
git-annex will then copy the file to the remote repository and store a symlink to the file in the Git repository.

When you commit the changes to your Git repository, git-annex will automatically commit the symlink to the file. This means that you can commit changes to large files without having to store the entire file in your local repository.

When you clone a Git repository that uses git-annex, git-annex will automatically download the large files from the remote repository. This means that you will have access to all of the large files in the repository, even if you don't have enough space in your local repository to store them all.
