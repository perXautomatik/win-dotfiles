Yes, a WSL for Windows Unix installation can be able to interact with the hard drives that the host Windows OS cannot access. This is because WSL 2 has a feature called "WSL mount" which allows you to mount a physical disk to WSL 2. This enables you to access filesystems that aren't natively supported by Windows (such as ext4).

To mount a physical disk to WSL 2, you can use the following command:

wsl --mount <disk_path>
For example, to mount the disk with the device ID \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0, you would use the following command:

wsl --mount \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0
Once the disk is mounted, you will be able to access it in WSL 2 at the /mnt/<disk_path> directory. For example, if you mounted the disk to the \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0 device ID, you would be able to access it at the /mnt/d directory in WSL 2.

It is important to note that the WSL mount feature does not support mounting a disk (or partitions that belong to the disk) that is currently in use. You also cannot mount the Windows installation disk.

Here are some examples of how to use the WSL mount feature to access hard drives that the host Windows OS cannot access:

Access a Linux partition on a dual boot system: If you have a dual boot system with Windows and Linux, you can use the WSL mount feature to access the Linux partition from Windows. To do this, you would first need to identify the device ID of the Linux partition. You can do this by using the following PowerShell command:
GET-CimInstance -query "SELECT * from Win32_DiskDrive"
The device IDs of the disks will be listed under the DeviceID column. Once you have identified the device ID of the Linux partition, you can use the following WSL mount command to mount it:

wsl --mount \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE<device_id>
For example, if the device ID of the Linux partition is \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE1, you would use the following command:

wsl --mount \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE1
Once the partition is mounted, you will be able to access it in WSL 2 at the /mnt/<device_id> directory. For example, if you mounted the partition to the \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE1 device ID, you would be able to access it at the /mnt/e directory in WSL 2.

Access a hard drive formatted with a Linux filesystem: If you have a hard drive that is formatted with a Linux filesystem, such as ext4, you can use the WSL mount feature to access it from Windows. To do this, you would use the following WSL mount command:
wsl --mount \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE<device_id>
For example, if the device ID of the hard drive is \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE2, you would use the following command:

wsl --mount \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE2
Once the hard drive is mounted, you will be able to access it in WSL 2 at the /mnt/<device_id> directory. For example, if you mounted the hard drive to the \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE2 device ID, you would be able to access it at the /mnt/f directory in WSL 2.
