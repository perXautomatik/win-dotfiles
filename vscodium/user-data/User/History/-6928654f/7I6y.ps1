#Sure, I can try to do that. Here is one possible way to break up the script into smaller functions:

.SYNOPSIS
Clones a repository with a reference to another repository and filters it by file names.

.DESCRIPTION
This script clones a repository with a reference to another repository and filters it by file names, using the CloneWithReference, branch-byPattern and Revert-byPattern functions. The script also uses the git ls-files and git branch commands to get the list of files and branches in the repository.

.PARAMETER Repo
The path of the original repository.

.PARAMETER ClonedRepo
The path of the cloned repository.

.PARAMETER Files
The list of file names to filter by.
