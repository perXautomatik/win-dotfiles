<#
can you write me a powershell script that takes a path to a git repo as input, for each untracked or staged file as addition not modification ; delete n discard this file if exsisting in worktree currently.  for each untracked or staged file as addition not modification ; delete one of the files if more than one file is has same content as another of the staged files or untracked files, prioritise deleting untracked files always, do check and search recursivly to make sure we don't rely on already deleted files
